# Baby_Day_Care
It is a Distributed database project, where we have used Oracle, notepad. Here, it can distribute the data to different computers. It was an app for a baby daycare center. The employee can view the database and see all the details. The customer can make payments here and we could see the baby's information in detail. It was overall a distributed database system.
